# World in Flames&REG; helper application

[World in Flames](https://www.a-d-g.com.au/collections/world-in-flames-collectors-edition) is a massive (an actual Guinness world record holder) boardgame in which players are the leaders of different major powers during the World War 2.
A player in the game does not only move units in the map, but also decides what kind of units are being built for fighting.

## Areas of interest for the application

* Force pool related decisions
* Convoy deployment
* Combat result predictions
* Neutrality pacts
* US entry
* Vichy creation
* Nuclear bomb research

Each of these areas will be handled with seperate modules and will be implemented individually.
